# heart-disease-classification
This notebook explores, analyses, processes, and models individual health data to classify if he/she has coronary heart diease using ML classification algorithms


The data used is from kaggle.
URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dileep070/heart-disease-prediction-using-logistic-regression/data

The data contains columns like Sex, Age, CurrSmoker, CigsPerDay, Diabetic, Glucose level, Heart Rate, Tot Chol, SysBP, DiaBP as input features.
The target variable is TenYearCHD (Coronary Heart Disease).

## How to run the notebook:
Run cmd: pip install -r requirements.txt 

This notebook focuses on selecting a model with high Recall (very low False negatives).

Different models are executed and their results are compared.

All the steps are discussed in detail in the notebook.

## Future Scope:
The next step is to focus on improving the precision (lowering False Positives) by better feature engineering, feature selection, model parameters selection etc. 

Watch out this space for an updated version of this notebook :)
